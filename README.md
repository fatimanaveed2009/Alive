Alive - Jump & Survive Game
Alive is a simple, fun, and engaging browser-based game where players control a character that must jump to avoid obstacles. The objective is to stay alive and score points by successfully dodging obstacles that come in the way.

Features:
Jump Mechanism: Use the arrow keys (up) on desktop, or touch the screen (on mobile devices) to make the character jump.

Obstacles: Snail-like obstacles move from right to left across the screen, and the player must avoid colliding with them to stay alive.

Score Counting: Every successful obstacle dodge adds to your score. The score is displayed at the top right corner.

Game Over Screen: If the character collides with the obstacle, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message will appear with the option to restart the game.

Background Music: Background music plays throughout the game to enhance the gaming experience.

Responsive Design: The game is fully responsive and works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It is optimized for landscape orientation for mobile devices.
